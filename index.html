										<p>My proudest achievement so far. The award winning Farmaid bot was designed to help out arond small greenhouses at a very affordable price.
											 Project Uses <bold>Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Robot Operating System, Arduino C, and C++ 11</bold>. 
											 The Project was self-funded and made in conjention with an independent team of engineers</p>

											<h3 class="major">Farmaid Bot 1.0</h3>
											<p>Built in response to the ARM Autonomous Robot Challenge, in summer 2018, I first wrote a small pitch which won a Raspberry Pi based Donkey Car robot.
												Then, I reached out to the Detroit Autonomous Vehicle Group to see if anyone with more electrical experience wanted to join me and was contacted by
												people with various specializations and over the course of July 2018 to September 2018, we set about creating our project. I was responsible for most of the 
												programming and some of the wiring and hardware. At the end the project won the award for Best Use of AI.
												A smaller version of it was built at Hack Harvard in October 2018 and won Most Fundable Hack award.

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/FarmaidBot2Resized.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Farmaid Bot 2.0</h3>
											<p>We gained some momentum from the last victory and I used it to pitch an update to the project at Optimize Eastern, a student group that 
												helps fund student enterperneurial projects. Here I won some funding and set about creating Farmaid Bot 2.0. Based on the success of the previous project, 
												the Detroit Autonomous Vehicle Group was able to do more marketing and attracted more volunteer researchers including an expert in Robot Operating System from Ford and 
												an electrical engineer from Crysler, while I was able to focus more on the computer vision tasks and move from classification to an object detection method.

											<h3 class="major">Impact Detection</h3>
											<p>
												I was given the problem of detecting collissions in ice hockey players and some tablular data along with videos of the game the data was extracted from,
												the restriction was that I was only allowed to use 8 columns from the 100+ column dataset as the other columns were collected at 100hz for each player 
												and increased the file size too much, lowering the size was first priority.
												For the size reduction, I created a method using Autoencoders, Support Vector Machines and Multi-Layer Preceptron and was successfully able to lower the 
												size while still getting good predictions. I also proposed a method to detect impacts via video data and crated a dataset to corelate the videos to the 
												tabular data and used an object detection based method to do detections and applied additional filters to remove false positives.
												The tasks resulted in two research papers being published in the American College Of Sports Medicine(ACSM) Journal.

										<article id="cot">
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/donkey-carResized.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Donkey Car</h3>
											<p>Since the chassis of the donkey car I won from Farmaid was not suitable for a greenhouse environment, I donated it to a professor at a different department who
												ran a meetup group to showacae student projects. I worked with him during my practicum course to train a model that could drive autonmously around a track and also
												on training a model via a simulated environment made in the Unity game engine.
												The project was displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
